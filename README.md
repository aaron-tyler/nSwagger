# SwaggerParser
A C# console app used to parse a swagger 2.0 file and produce a C# file for a client side app.

This is kinda a quick internal project I needed but I think maybe useful for others. It is a bit of a mess with the biggest 
issue being the the C# generation is just string concat and really should be something better (T4, roslyn... hmm).
