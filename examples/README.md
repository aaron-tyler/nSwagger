# Examples

This folder contains a number of .json files which are saved Swagger 2.0 definations. Each file in here is processed through the tools available to produce a TypeScript defination for the Swagger defination and a C# client class for the Swagger defination.  
The TypeScript files can be found in [TS-Examples](TS-Examples) and the C# files can be found in [C#-Examples](C#-Examples).

A good place to start is with the standard [PetStore](petstore.json) Swagger example, which generated to the following:  
- [TypeScript Defination](TS-Examples/petstore.ts)  
- [C# client](C#-Examples/petstore.cs)
